<h2>Introduction</h2>

<h4 class="red">Words in red are answers</h4>

<p class="margin-top-20">In Lesson One, we learned about the concept of empathy and how it relates to your role as an ESL 
instructor. We acknowledged the concept as multifaceted and, oftentimes, described in various ways.</p> 

<p>The many definitions of empathy can be grouped into three categories. Do you recall which?</p>
 
<ol>
  <li>
    <strong class="red"><u>(Cognitive)</u></strong>: ability to know how another person thinks and feels, or their internal state. 
    Can be achieved through a number of strategies such as perspective taking (placing yourself in 
    the perspective of another person) and active listening.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong class="red"><u>(Emotional)</u></strong>: also known as “affective,” the ability to feel how another person feels. 
    Can also be achieved through perspective taking and active listening.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong class="red"><u>(Compassionate)</u></strong>: takes a step beyond knowing and sharing, and moves a person to actually
       act upon their understanding of another’s thoughts and feelings.
  </li>
</ol>
	

<p>Ultimately, the lesson ended by defining empathy as <strong>the ability to participate in the experience of another</strong>, 
both cognitively and emotionally. Moreover, participants understood the connection of empathy to self-awareness, 
and how to be empathetic as a person and an effective ESL instructor.</p>

<p>This second module further explores the concept of empathy, and specifically, one way to improve one’s empathy as
an ever-developing skill. The module will focus on gaining empathy through perspective taking, or experiencing a
situation in another person’s shoes.</p>
