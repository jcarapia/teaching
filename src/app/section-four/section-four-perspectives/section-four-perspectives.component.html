<h2>Perspective and Resources</h2>

<p class="margin-top-20"><em>What does it mean to be ethnocentric, and ethnorelative?</em></p>

<p>This final lesson combines all material learned in the previous lessons, and continues to detail how to teach with 
empathy and intercultural sensitivity. In order to do that, it is worth restating that these are skills and, just 
like anything else, they are developed as part of a process. This lesson will elaborate on what that process looks like.</p>  

<p>This lesson will follow the previous modules by drawing upon the work of Dr. Milton Bennett, intercultural
communication expert and researcher. Dr. Bennett created a scale on which to gauge one’s level of intercultural
sensitivity: the Developmental Model of Intercultural Sensitivity (DMIS).</p>
