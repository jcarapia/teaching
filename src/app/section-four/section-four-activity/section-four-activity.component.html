<h2>Activity</h2>

<p>Based on this scale, an <em>ethnocentric</em> viewpoint looks at the world from a person’s own culture first. In
contrast, an <em>ethnorelative</em> view considers a person’s own culture as relative to others around the world.</p>

<p>Now definitions will be further clarified with a short activity. In the next few pages, you will read 
statements related to ESL teaching. Choose whether the statements are <strong class="red">ethnocentric</strong> or
<strong class="red">ethnorelative</strong>.</p>

<p class="margin-top-20">“Regardless of my students’ backgrounds and cultures, we’re all the same as people.”</p> 
<label class="radio-inline">
  <input type="radio" name="question1" id="question1-1" value="ethnocentric" (change)="response('q1','ec')">ETHNOCENTRIC
</label>
<label class="radio-inline">
  <input type="radio" name="question1" id="question1-2" value="ethnorelative" (change)="response('q1','er')">ETHNORELATIVE
</label>

<p class="margin-top-15" [ngClass]="answers.q1 == 'ec' ? 'green' : 'red'" *ngIf="answers.q1">
ETHNOCENTRIC<br>  
<strong>Explanation</strong>: while this idea seems positive at first glance, it does not validate the student’s backgrounds as 
important enough to understand. This risks trivializing the differences that students may have with the
teacher, as those differences may matter in the classroom environment. This would fit into the minimization 
stage of the DMIS.</p>
<hr>

<p>“In my student’s home country, they drive on the wrong side of the road.” </p>
<label class="radio-inline">
    <input type="radio" name="question1" id="question2-1" value="ethnocentric" (change)="response('q2','ec')">ETHNOCENTRIC
  </label>
  <label class="radio-inline">
    <input type="radio" name="question1" id="question2-2" value="ethnorelative" (change)="response('q2','er')">ETHNORELATIVE
  </label>

<p class="margin-top-15" [ngClass]="answers.q2 == 'ec' ? 'green' : 'red'" *ngIf="answers.q2">
ETHNOCENTRIC<br>   
<strong>Explanation</strong>: the term “wrong side” implies that the speaker’s culture drives on the right side of the road. 
This exemplifies the speaker’s culture as central to reality. This could be considered part of the denial
or defense stage of the DMIS.</p>
<hr>

<p>“It’s hard for my student to write in English because his native language is written backwards.” </p>
<label class="radio-inline">
    <input type="radio" name="question1" id="question3-1" value="ethnocentric" (change)="response('q3','ec')">ETHNOCENTRIC
  </label>
  <label class="radio-inline">
    <input type="radio" name="question1" id="question3-2" value="ethnorelative" (change)="response('q3','er')">ETHNORELATIVE
  </label>

<p class="margin-top-15" [ngClass]="answers.q3 == 'ec' ? 'green' : 'red'" *ngIf="answers.q3">
ETHNOCENTRIC<br>   
<strong>Explanation</strong>: the word “backward” is used pejoratively to describe another culture, and implies that the 
writing system is incorrect. This portrays the speaker’s culture as superior and the student’s culture as 
inferior. This statement works within the Defense stage of the DMIS.</p>
<hr>

<p>“As long as we all speak the same language, there’s no problem.”</p>
<label class="radio-inline">

  </label>

<p class="margin-top-15" [ngClass]="answers.q4 == 'ec' ? 'green' : 'red'" *ngIf="answers.q4">
ETHNOCENTRIC<br> 
<strong>Explanation</strong>: This statement discounts the existence of other cultures, and seemingly threatens to eliminate a 
cultural difference that may appear. This fits into the Denial stage of the DMIS.</p>

  <label class="radio-inline">
    <input type="radio" name="question1" id="question5-2" value="ethnorelative" (change)="response('q5','er')">ETHNORELATIVE
  </label>

<p class="margin-top-15" [ngClass]="answers.q5 == 'ec' ? 'green' : 'red'" *ngIf="answers.q5">
ETHNOCENTRIC<br>   
<strong>Explanation</strong>: This statement implies that smiling is part of a universal greeting, which is not always the case. 
This prioritizes the speaker’s cultural norms over possible others.</p>

<strong>Explanation</strong>: This statement acknowledges the need to meet the student where they are, and even adapt to

ETHNORELATIVE<br> 
<strong>Explanation</strong>: Instead of moving to a defensive posture when seeing a student behaving in a contrary way, 
the speaker investigated the cultural norms of the student. This showed interest in other cultures and placement 
of the speaker’s culture as relative to others.</p>
